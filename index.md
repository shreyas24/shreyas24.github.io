I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/) at [The University of Iowa](http://uiowa.edu). My advisor is Prof. [Sriram Pemmaraju](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sriram).  

My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, more specifically in Distributed Algorithms, Communication Complexity, Combinatorial Optimization, and Algorithmic Game Theory
