I am a third year PhD student in the [[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/][Department of Computer Science]] at [[http://uiowa.edu][The University of Iowa]]. My advisor is Prof. [[http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sriram][Sriram Pemmaraju]].


My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, more specifically in Distributed Algorithms, Communication Complexity, Combinatorial Optimization, and Algorithmic Game Theory
