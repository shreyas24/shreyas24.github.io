I am a postdoc in the [[https://research.cs.aalto.fi/theory/][Theory group]] at [[https://aalto.fi/en][Aalto University]] hosted by Prof. [[https://users.aalto.fi/~uittoj3/][Jara Uitto]].
I received my PhD in Computer Science at [[http://uiowa.edu][The University of Iowa]] under the supervision of Prof. [[http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sriram][Sriram Pemmaraju]] in Spring 2021.

My research interests generally lie in Theoretical Computer Science, more specifically in Distributed Algorithms, Communication Complexity, and Combinatorial Optimization.

During my PhD, I worked as a research assistant in the [[https://vinci.cs.uiowa.edu/compepi/][Computational Epidemiology Group]] where we try to understand and model the spread of Hospital Acquired Infections (see [[https://www.cdc.gov/hai/research/MIND-Healthcare.html][here]] for more information).

Here is my [[./cv.pdf][CV]]. My ORCID: [[https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2409-7807][0000-0003-2409-7807]]. And here are links to my [[https://arxiv.org/a/pai_s_2.html][arXiv]] and [[https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pai:Shreyas][dblp]] pages.
