[[./img/me.jpg]]

I am a fifth year PhD student in the [[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/][Department of Computer Science]] at [[http://uiowa.edu][The University of Iowa]]. My advisor is Prof. [[http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sriram][Sriram Pemmaraju]].

My research interests generally lie in Theoretical Computer Science, more specifically in Distributed Algorithms, Communication Complexity, Combinatorial Optimization, and Algorithmic Game Theory. I was a part of the [[https://vinci.cs.uiowa.edu/compepi/][Computational Epidemiology Group]] from Fall 2017 to Spring 2019 where I worked on understanding and modeling the spread of Hospital Acquired Infections (see [[https://www.cdc.gov/hai/research/MIND-Healthcare.html][here]] for more).

Here is my [[./cv.pdf][CV]]. And these are links to my [[https://arxiv.org/a/pai_s_2.html][arXiv]] and [[https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pai:Shreyas][dblp]] pages.
